To scaffold a portfolio using `create-boring-portfolio`, run the command below:

<br>

```bash
npx create-boring-portfolio
```

Once you have initiated the process you will have to provide a name for your portfolio.

Then you will be prompted to enter your GitHub usename. This is so we can use the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch the projects which you have selected to be showcased in the projects section of your portfolio.

Finally you will be asked to provide the topic tag you would like to use to identify which projects should be showcased. By default this is set to `showcase`.
